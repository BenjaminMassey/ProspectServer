	PS 378 Survey

	My name is Ben Massey, and I'm a student at the University of Oregon taking
	Political Science 378: Games in Politics. As a part of
	my final I've made this website in order to gather data.
	<br><br>
	This will be a survey. There will be a series of questions.
	Each question will provide two options, and you must choose
	only one. Each option will give you certain chances of winning
	or losing money. 
	<br><br>
	Treat it like a would you rather. "Would you rather
	have a 50% chance to win $500 or a 25% chance to
	win $1500?" would involve weighing the pros and cons
	of chance versus reward for each choice, and then
	choosing which you'd prefer.
	<br><br>
	Try and act like you are doing this for real: 
	like the money is actually at stake.
	<br><br>
	When you are ready to start,
